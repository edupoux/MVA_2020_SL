# Algorithms for speech and natural language processing (MVA 2018)
# Course materials

## Course Objectives

Speech and natural language processing is a subfield of artificial intelligence used in an increasing number of applications; yet, while some aspects are on par with human performances, others are lagging behind. This course will present the full stack of speech and language technology, from automatic speech recognition to parsing and semantic processing. The course will present, at each level, the key principles, algorithms and mathematical principles behind the state of the art, and confront them with what is know about human speech and language processing. Students will acquire detailed knowledge of the scientific issues and computational techniques in automatic speech and language processing and will have hands on experience in implementing and evaluating the important algorithms.
 
Topics:
- speech features & signal processing
- hidden markov & finite state modeling
- probabilistic parsing
- continuous embeddings
- deep learning for language-related tasks (DNNs, RNNs)
- linguistics and psycholinguistics
- comparing human and machine performance

## Prerequisites
Basic linear algebra, calculus, probability theory

(235B): 29 rue d'Ulm, Paris 5, 2nd Floor, left.
(Dussane): 45 rue d'Ulm, Paris 5, Ground Floor, left.
(Actes): 45 rue d'Ulm, Paris 5, Salle des actes, 1st Floor, right.
(TBA): The room is still unspecified, keep checking this repo for updates.

The course materials (PDFs, etc.) are listed in the subdirectories numbered #1 .. #8. 

### Practical assignments (TD)
The practical assignments are given on the courses #2 to #6. For the assignments, students are provided with the necessary data and Python code in the form of a disk image (.iso) to be mounted and booted from a virtual machine. They will hand in their source code and a max two page report, detailing their work, the difficulties encountered and the results. 

### Quizzes

During the courses, we will use on-line quizzes (on the smartphone/computer) to probe comprehension and trigger discussion.
